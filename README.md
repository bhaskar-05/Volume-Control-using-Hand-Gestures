Control your system volume in real-time using your hand gestures!
This project uses OpenCV & MediaPipe to track your hand via webcam, measures the distance between your thumb & index finger, and maps it to the system volume.
Works on macOS (using AppleScript to change volume).

✅ Real-time webcam-based hand tracking
✅ Detects thumb–index finger distance
✅ Maps distance to system volume (0–100)
✅ Smooth, intuitive gesture control
✅ Visual feedback: landmarks, bounding box, distance line
